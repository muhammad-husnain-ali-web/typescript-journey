## Day 2 – First TypeScript Code

### What happens when running tsc
- TypeScript checks code for errors
- Converts .ts file to .js if no error
- If there is an error, it stops and shows a message

### Difference between TS and JS
- TS is for development with types
- JS is what runs in browser or Node
- Browser and Node only run .js, not .ts

### Example error caught
- Assigning a number to a string variable caused a TypeScript error
