## Day 3 – Basic Types in TypeScript

### What are basic types?
- Basic types define what kind of data a variable can store

### Why any is bad
- any disables type checking
- It makes TypeScript act like JavaScript

### Why unknown is safer
- unknown requires type checking before use
- It prevents unsafe operations

### Error TypeScript caught
- Assigning a string to a number variable caused a compile-time error
